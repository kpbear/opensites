# opensites
a quick python script that opens a csv list of sites all at once

a great use would be if you find yourself opening the same 10 websites everyday. 

create your own CSV file of the websites, make sure the file included in the script is named in the code. 
(currently it is site-list.csv)

run this script and they will all open. 

* note the script assumes domains in CSV are https://


on mac 

in terminal you would navigate to where the script is saved 

then excute command...

python opensites.py
